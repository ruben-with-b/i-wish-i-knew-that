    <p>The GDPR became a topic of discussion in 25. Mai 2018. Due to the tightening of the laws it is possible that the user gets a precise overview of his collected data. If the user wishes to have his data, he can request them from the respective provider and receive a package of Json files.
      Which file says what? What are Json files? What should I do with that? The first impression is usually confusing and not understandable, especially not for someone without programming knowledge. And this is where our platform comes in. We want everyone to understand what happens to their data.
      Simple, clearly laid out and still fun to use.
